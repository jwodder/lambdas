- Support "_" as a name for an unusable and repeatable lambda argument
- Add a `parseFile` function with the following features:
 - Supports #-comments
 - Treats newlines as expression terminators, except when they end with a
   backslash (which is removed before parsing)
 - Enables defining new free variables with "X := ..." syntax
- Rename `parse` to `parseExpr` and `parseExpr` to something else (or make it
  part of the new `parseExpr`?)
