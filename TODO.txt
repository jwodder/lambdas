- Add documentation
- Add a README
- Add an alternative to := that strictly evaluates its right argument
- Rename `FreeVar` to something more accurate?
- Add the following features to repl.py:
 - a way to change lambdas.builtin_limit
 - a :help statement
 - a :last variable
 - a way to step through evaluation of expressions in imported files
 - a way to jump straight to the end when stepping through evaluations
 - (better) readline history
 - Get rid of the blank lines between expression steps
- Add a predefined value for the `preimport` argument to `parseFile` that
  avoids reimporting already-imported files
- Make `parseFile` add filename and line number information to `LambdaError`s
  encountered during parsing
- Make Lambda.eval call .eval on its expr?
- Add a mutating alternative to .eval in order to cut down on repeated
  computations
- Make :import take its argument as a Python string parsed with
  `ast.literal_eval` (requires v.2.6+)
- Add Builtins for concatenating and splitting Atoms?
- Add an error/undefined/⊥ Builtin?
- How should `parseFile` handle occurrences of ":import" at locations other
  than the start of a line and/or followed by special characters ("()λ." etc.)
  without intervening spaces?
- Make repl.py handle errors thrown by `parseFile`?
