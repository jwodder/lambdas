- Add documentation
- Add a README

 - a way to jump straight to the end when stepping through evaluations
 - (better) readline history
 - Get rid of the blank lines between expression steps
- Add a predefined value for the `preimport` argument to `parseFile` that
  avoids reimporting already-imported files

  with StringIO
